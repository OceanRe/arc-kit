## Instructions

Generate a comprehensive ISO 27001:2022 compliance assessment:

1. **Load the template**: Use `.arckit/templates/iso27001-assessment-template.md`

2. **Understand the project context**:
   - Organization type and industry
   - ISMS scope (systems, processes, locations)
   - Current certification status
   - Certification body (if applicable)

3. **Assess ISMS Requirements (Clauses 4-10)**:
   - Clause 4: Context of the Organization
   - Clause 5: Leadership
   - Clause 6: Planning
   - Clause 7: Support
   - Clause 8: Operation
   - Clause 9: Performance Evaluation
   - Clause 10: Improvement

4. **Assess Annex A Controls (93 controls)**:
   - 5. Organizational Controls (37 controls)
   - 6. People Controls (8 controls)
   - 7. Physical Controls (14 controls)
   - 8. Technological Controls (34 controls)

5. **For each clause/control**:
   - Status: ✅ CONFORMING | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ❌ NON-CONFORMING | N/A
   - Current implementation
   - Gaps (Major NC, Minor NC, OFI)
   - Remediation actions

6. **Create Statement of Applicability (SoA) summary**

7. **Map to related frameworks**:
   - SOC2 Trust Service Criteria mapping
   - Solvency 2 alignment

8. **Save output**: `projects/[project-folder]/iso27001-assessment.md`

## Non-Conformity Classification

**Major Non-Conformity**: Absence or total breakdown of required ISMS process
**Minor Non-Conformity**: Single observed lapse in meeting a requirement
**OFI**: Opportunity for improvement (not a non-conformity)

## Status Indicators

**Clause Conformity**:
- **✅ CONFORMING**: Requirement fully met
- **⚠️ PARTIAL**: Requirement partially met
- **❌ NON-CONFORMING**: Requirement not met

**Annex A Control Status**:
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED**: Control fully implemented
- **⚠️ PARTIAL**: Control exists but gaps
- **❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED**: Control not implemented
- **N/A**: Control not applicable

## Output Format

Provide:
1. **Location**: `projects/NNN-project-name/iso27001-assessment.md`
2. **Summary**:
   - Controls assessed by domain
   - Major/Minor non-conformities
   - Certification readiness
3. **Recommendations**: Prioritized corrective actions
